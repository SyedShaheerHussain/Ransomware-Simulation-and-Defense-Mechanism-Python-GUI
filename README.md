## ⚠️ CAUTION & DISCLAIMERS

### **Cautions**

>[!caution]
> - This software simulates a ransomware attack within a dedicated `sandbox` folder.
> - **DO NOT** use the simulation keys or engines on your personal or sensitive data.
> - Always ensure the simulation path is correctly pointing to the project's internal `sandbox` directory.

### **Disclaimers**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is built for **EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY**.
> The authors and contributors are not responsible for any misuse of the techniques or code provided. Using these methods against systems without explicit permission is illegal and unethical.

### **Notes**

>[!note]
> - All simulated "attacks" are performed on mock files within a local directory.

## 🛡️ INTRODUCTION

In an era where ransomware causes billions in global damages, understanding the "Kill Chain" and defense strategies is critical. **CyberLab** is a comprehensive toolkit designed to demonstrate how ransomware operates—from delivery to encryption—and how elite defense systems detect, block, and recover from such threats.

### **What is Ransomware?**

Ransomware is a type of malicious software (malware) designed to block access to a computer system or encrypt data until a sum of money (ransom) is paid.

- **Real-Life Example**: The _WannaCry_ attack of 2017 encrypted hundreds of thousands of computers globally, crippling hospitals and businesses.
- **The Mechanism**: It typically gains access via phishing or vulnerabilities, then uses asymmetric or symmetric encryption to lock files.

### **What is a Defense Mechanism?**

A defense mechanism is a proactive or reactive security measure taken to protect digital assets.

- **Example**: Behavior monitoring (watching for high-speed file changes) or automated backups (snapshots).
- **Safety Strategy**: Maintaining the "3-2-1" backup rule (3 copies, 2 different media, 1 offsite).

## 🚀 INSTALLATION & RUNNING

### **Simulated Attack Types (Simulation Modes)**

1. **Burst Attack**: High-speed, sequential encryption (Noisy).
2. **Stealth Attack**: Low and slow encryption with sleep intervals (Evasive).
3. **Random Spray**: Encrypts files in a non-linear order to bypass simple monitors.

## ✨ FEATURES & FUNCTIONS

### **1. Navigation Console (UI/UX)**

- **Neon Aesthetic**: A cinematic, high-contrast dashboard with particle backgrounds and CRT scanline overlays.
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time alerts and progress bars for every operation.

### **2. Simulation Engine**

- **`Launch Ransomware Attack`**: Triggers the cryptographic engine to lock simulator files.
- **`Process Simulator`**: Automates complex attack patterns (Stealth vs. Burst).

### **3. Defense Operations Center**

- **Behavior Monitoring**: Real-time file system watchers (`watchdog`) detect unauthorized changes.
- **Honeypot Traps**: Fake sensitive files that trigger an immediate alarm if touched.
- **AI Anomaly Engine**: Established baseline system metrics; alerts on 2.5x standard deviations in CPU/IO.

### **4. Key Vault & Identity**

- **Key Manager**: Generates and archives encryption keys (Fernet).
- **MFA (TOTP)**: Requires a 6-digit code (simulated via `pyotp`) to perform sensitive "Restore" actions.
- **RBAC**: Role-Based Access Control (Admin vs. Operator).

### **5. Forensic Lab**

- **Memory Dumps**: Captures simulated "strings" and "anomalies" found during an attack.
- **Pen-Test Scanner**: Vulnerability scanning module to find paths like "Insecure Backups" or "Weak Auth".
